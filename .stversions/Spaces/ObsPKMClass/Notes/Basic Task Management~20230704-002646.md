## Basic Task Management

[[Tasks Dates|Date fields for tasks]]


## Recurring tasks

- Start with the keyword `every`
- Add `when done` to make the date of the new recurring task based on the completion date and not the original due date

Examples:

🔁 every 3 days
🔁 every 10 days when done
🔁 every weekday (meaning every Mon - Fri)
🔁 every week on Sunday
🔁 every month on the last
🔁 every 6 months on the 2nd last Friday
🔁 every April and December on the 1st and 24th (meaning every April 1st and December 24th)

## Priorities

In order high to low

|Icon|Significance/Query|
|---|---|
|🔺|highest|
|⏫ |high|
|🔼|medium|
|no signifier|no priority|
|🔽|low|
|⏬️|lowest|

Example: `priority is high`. Can also use `above`, `below`, `not`.

## Statuses

We will only use the two basic statuses, checked or unchecked, indicated by `- [x]` and `- [ ]` and which correspond to `done` or `not done`

## Queries




### Description

`description includes`

### Multiple filters

Each new line describes an `AND` operator. All standard boolean operators are recognized, `NOT`, `AND`, `OR`, `AND NOT`, `OR NOT` and `XOR`. Related filters must be wrapped in parentheses.

## Tags

Existence: `has tags`, `no tags`
`tags include`, `tags do not include`

## File properties

`path includes`, `path does not include`
`folder includes`, `folder does not include`
`filename includes`, `filename does not include`

## Limit

`limit 10`
`limit groups 3` when using sorting, limit of tasks in each group

## Sorting and grouping

`sort by`, `sort by <something> reverse`
multiple (nested) sorting by listing different criteria on different lines

`group by`
