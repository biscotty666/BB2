### Personal Knowledge Management

> [!tip] Wikipedia
> Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to __gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share__ knowledge in their daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities. It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own growth and learning. It is a bottom-up approach to knowledge management.

### The traditional approach  


People have many methods for note-taking:  <!-- element align="left" -->

- Notebooks <!-- element class="fragment"  -->
- Index Cards <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Computers <!-- element class="fragment" -->

__But...__ <!-- element class="fragment" style="color:red;"-->

How do you find the information again? How long does it take? <!-- element class="fragment" -->

__And...__ <!-- element class="fragment"  style="color:red;"-->

In practice, the more extensive your notes the less accessible any piece of information is! <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:
The traditional approach to taking notes is to make detailed notebooks with pages full of notes with dividers for each subject/section. Some people we'll make extensive use of highlighters in books. Some people take their notes on index cards which then are stored in boxes piled one on top of another.

Keeping your notes on a computer is somewhat better since it's easy to have your files with you at all times and you can search through any individual file much easier.. assuming you know which file to look in.

In a way, the better, more extensive your notes the slower your retrieval process even if you're clever about it. 

The challenge is getting information back out. And not just next week, maybe next year or in 2 years. Maybe you are writing an article and there are notes you took a long time ago that you forgot about but that are relevant.

Let's look at the way Personal Knowledge Management, in conjunction with Obsidian, addresses each part of the definition given above.

- Gather 
- Classify
- Store 
- Search and retrieve 
- Share

### And add one more

## Discover new relationships <!-- element class="fragment" style="color: red;" -->

---

### Gather
#### Two main sources of information <!-- element class="fragment"  -->
1. Media (books, articles, videos, etc.) <!-- element class="fragment" -->
2. Your brain! <!-- element class="fragment" -->

#### Note-taking techniques:  <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1.5em;"-->
1. Atomic notes <!-- element class="fragment" -->
2. Fleeting notes <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

There are two main sources of information: media like books and video that you consume and your own ideas and thoughts.

For books and video we rely on a particular system of note taking which focuses on atomic notes. We will cover this a lot more later but the general idea is that notes should be stored as small complete and independent pieces of information, like index cards.

For your own thoughts and ideas obsidian allows you to quickly jot things down as they occur to you, to which you can then go back later and ponder, _develop_, classify, or delete.

---

### Classify

- Review your note to ensure clarity <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Relate the note to at least one other note <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Tag the note to describe it's nature and/or content <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

Once you have taken a note it is important to classify it somehow in your system, in your card catalog so to speak. 

There are many ways to do this and personal preference comes into your decision. Obsidian is nice because you can always change your mind if you decide that the organization that you've chosen isn't working out for you or you just want to expand on it.

This is a good time to think about how this note relates to other notes in your vault. But don't worry, Obsidian's  search is so powerful that it will retrieve information even if it's not explicitly tied to other information.

---

### Store

- All notes are plain text <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Notes are stored locally on your computer <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Storage for life <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

Obsidian stores all of your notes in plain text files on your computer. Which means all of your information is yours and will always be accessible no matter what happens with Obsidian itself. So this is storage for life.

---

### Search and retrieve

leverage he power of obsidian. We will spend time later going through all of the ways you can quickly:

1. Find specific information you are looking for <!-- element class="fragment" -->
2. Assemble all of your information on any given topic <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

### Share

There are many ways you can share information from your vault.
- Send a copy of notes, directories or your entire vault  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Keep a copy of your vault in cloud storage or GitHub <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Make videos, write articles... create something! <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

1. Since they are just text files you can simply send them to someone else and they can put them in their own vault and open them up and look at them.
2. You can put your vault online or in the cloud, using something like github.org where other people can view whatever information you want to share.
3. You can write articles or -_produce new_ videos from the information and ideas you have in your vault.

---

### Discovery of relationships

- As your vault grows the number of related notes grow.  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- These inter-connected notes become a neural network <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Gain insights and new ideas <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Produce something new <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

This wasn't part of the definition above but it is an important way to use your vault.

As your vault grows, you will have more and more interrelated information. 

Obsidian makes it easy to discover related notes and information even if you were not aware of the relationship when you made the note.

Over time the network will have so many connections notes that patterns and relationships will emerge.
