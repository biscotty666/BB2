#### Footnotes in Obsidian

1. Footnotes can be declared by putting, eg.  `[^1]` after some text. Anywhere else in the note you declare the content of the footnote with `[^1]:`.

I would like to give this text a reference[^1]

[^1]:The content of the reference

2. You can add the contents of the reference in-line as well with `^[in-line reference]` ^8f03aa

In this case I'll just make a citation^[in-line citation] in-line.

3. Citations can contain links, formatting and backlinks

I gave a quote in an earlier note[^2]

Notice that it automatically adjusts the numbering of the footnotes in display view
