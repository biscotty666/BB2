#### Backlinks

- Links to other notes
- Can link directly to headers
- Can link to paragraphs

Links are created by using square brackets. Immediately after the name of the note special characters can be added to:

| Character | Purpose                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| \|        | Display the text instead of the note name |
| #         | Links directly to a header                |
| #^        | Links to a paragraph                      |

Notes can be embedded by adding a ! before the note.
