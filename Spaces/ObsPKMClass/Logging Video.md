## Logging Observations in Obsidian

### Purpose

Pulling together what we've learned so far by implementing a logging system.

### Scenario

I'm interested in the animal activity in my yard. I'd like to keep track of the birds that I see and learn more about them.

### Implementation

Our implementation will consist of:
1. A template for our observations
2. A Map of Content listing all observations for various time periods
3. An Evergreen Note or Map of Content for certain birds of particular interest

### Video

1. Demonstration of system
2. Walkthroughs
	1. Template
	2. Observation MOC
	3. Species detail
