#### Note-taking in the age of computers

Information stored digitally allows for greater volume and quicker retrieval. **However** note-taking practices in the US did not change. So quicker, but not that much quicker. 

Students take notes by making a file for each class, or section, or chapter. But this is just like annotating books.

And still, the more information, the more files to look through to find what you want.

**We need a change of paradigm.**

** And a tool to implement it.**
