#### Fleeting Notes

- In developing a Zettelkasten, fleeting notes are the seeds.
- Best practice is to quickly capture interesting thoughts.
- They should usually be left undeveloped and returned to later
- Some will be deleted upon reflection
- Others will be developed
	- Made atomic
	- Augmented with [[Metadata|metadata]]
	- Stored as a _permanent note_
- We will keep these in the `+ New` directory in our vault

#### Permanent Notes

We can distinguish 2 types of Permanent Notes.

##### Reference notes

These include

- Information and data from reference material
- Any notes taken from identified sources
- quotations and other peoples ideas
- We will keep these in the `Sources` directory in our vault

##### Evergreen notes

- Your own ideas
- You will return to these notes and develop them as you gain more information related to your topic, hence the name
- We will keep these in the `Cards` folder in our vault
