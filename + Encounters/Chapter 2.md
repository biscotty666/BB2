### Zettelkasten

> [!tip] Wikipedia
> AÂ **_Zettelkasten_**Â (German: "slip box", pluralÂ **_ZettelkÃ¤sten_**) orÂ **card file**Â consists of small items of information stored on paper slips or cards that may be linked to each other throughÂ [subject headings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term "Index term")Â or otherÂ [metadata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata")Â such as numbers andÂ [tags](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata) "Tag (metadata)")

### Zettelkasten Users

> [!tip] Shannon Mattern
> Over the decades, cards put to personal use have provided aesthetic and intellectual inspiration to myriad artists, writers, and designers."

### Zettelkasten Users

> [!tip] Frank Halasz
> Its intended users are authors, researchers, designers, and other intellectual laborers engaged in analyzing information, constructing models, formulating arguments, designing artifacts, and generally processing ideas.

### Zettelkasten Origins <!-- element style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" -->

- Earliest examples from 16th century
- Became common among European scholars in the 19th century <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Famously used by Carl Linnaeus in developing the modern system of biological taxonomy <!-- element class="fragment" -->

### A  17$^{th}$ century example

<!-- .slide: style="padding: 2em;" -->
### $20^{th}$ century

- Little used in the US until the $20^{th}$ century
- Scholars still kept notes in books, or slips pasted in books <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---
### Niklas Luhmann

- Mid-20$^{th}$ century social scientist
- Wrote more than 70 books and 400 articles
- Had more than 90,000 index cards

### The computer age

Information stored digitally allows for 
- Greater volume
- Quicker retrieval

<span class="my-emph">However</span>

Note-taking practices in the US did not change. So quicker, but not _that_ much quicker.

---

### Zettelkasten to the rescue

Book/notebook style note-taking is inherently inefficient!

And the more information, the slower the retrieval.

We need to apply the principles of Zettelkasten using powerful tools such as <!-- element class="fragment" --> 

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" -->
<span class="obs-emph">**Obsidian**</span> 
:::

Other famous zettelkasteners

- George Carlin <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 0.5em" -->
- Phyllis Diller <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Joan Rivers <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Bob Hope <!-- element class="fragment" -->

Zettelers! ðŸ¤£  <!-- element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1em" -->

Sorry ðŸ˜Œ <!-- element class="fragment" -->

### Atomic notes

1. Short ideas or pieces of information (atoms) <!-- element class="fragment" -->
2. Think index card size <!-- element class="fragment" -->
3. Self-contained and understandable without reference to other information <!-- element class="fragment" -->
4. May change or evolve over time <!-- element class="fragment" -->
5. Should contain metatdata <!-- element class="fragment" -->
	- references (links to other notes) <!-- element style="margin-top: 0.5em" -->
	- hierarchy (parent, sibling, next)
	- tags (flexible)

note:

Making atomic notes become part of the learning process. It forces you to clarify your understanding of every point.

Working with Zettelkasten forces/nudges you to think about your thinking.

You may return to your notes when you gain more information or insight relating to the topic. 

You may want to add metatdata.

Don't get too obsessed with the size. Just keep in mind that broad topics are for other types of notes (mocs or production notes)

---

### Fleeting notes

For quickly capturing
- Undeveloped ideas  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Interesting information you encounter <!-- element class="fragment" -->
<br />

Before you forget them ðŸ˜‰ <!-- element class="fragment" -->

Fleeting notes will evolve into permanent notes or be discarded.  <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note:

Immediacy is important so that you can get back to ideas and information and not forget about them

There is no harm keeping them around though so don't be quick to discard. Maybe you should come back to it later. You could even note how many times you had looked at the note with metadata.

You are encouraged not to return immediately to your fleeting notes. It's often better to return to them later.

---

### Permanent/Evergreen notes

A note that has been given appropriate metadata and placed in the hierarchical structure. It is the evolution of a fleeting note.

---

### Map of content (MOC)

As you accumulate notes around a given topic, you can create MOCs for the subject.

MOCs are not atomic. They are "guides" through the information you have in your vault.

They are like an annotated table of contents or index.

Eventually some will become rich enough to become a new product.

---

### Production Notes

I find it useful to distinguish another type of note.

They can be thought of as an enriched map of content.

They are larger documents which develop or expose your ideas drawing on notes in your vault and incorporating non-textual elements such as images, drawings, graphs, charts, etc

The intended audience is external

---

### Daily Note

These are not traditional zettelkasten notes.

Daily notes allow you to organize other aspects of your vault and your personal knowledge Management.

They serve as a central organizational point for your activities as well as documenting history.

Allow for logging and task management 

---

### implementing zettelkasten in obsidian

An opportunity to think about how you think.

Many different approaches, choose one that feels clear and understandable and simple to you. 

After a while you may decide to change which is relatively easy.

---

### Implementation considerations

- folders
- templates
- tags
- data fields (dataview)
- contents of daily notes

---

### Folders

I'm using the ACCESS structure from [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com)

- <span class="access">A</span>tlas (mocs) 
- <span class="access">C</span>ards (evergreen notes)
- <span class="access">C</span>alendar (daily notes)
- <span class="access">E</span>xtras (templates, images, drawings, etc)
- <span class="access">S</span>ources (literature notes)
- <span class="access">S</span>paces (production notes)

note:
An additional directory is actually needed for the fleeting notes.

### Templates and Daily notes

---

### Tags and data fields

---


With the Advent of computers these physical issues go away and the possibilities for metadata grow considerably.

Recently software has been developed that allows us to truly implement a zeto casting system liberal, flexible use of metadata.

Obsidian stands out against its rivals for a few reasons:
1. Flexible use of metadata 
2. Rich method for cross referencing data
3. Ease of incorporating non-textual elements
4. Of creating references and footnotes
5. Powerful search function to ensure that nothing gets lost
6. It's free
7. Your actual notes and all of your data are stored in text files and other non proprietary formats so they can be used independently of obsidian
8. Follows the principal that your data is your own to do what you want with
